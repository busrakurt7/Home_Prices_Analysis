# Home Prices Analysis

### Background

A case study that is focused on a business research. In this study I worked an analyst at an investment bank. The team that I am working with wanted to understand how it should allocate dollars earmarked for investment into mortgage-backed securities. They've asked me to look into the factors that drive home prices. Basic data exploration was done and ultimately developped. At least one—and ideally several—hypotheses were tested 


A PowerPoint deck that provides an analysis of the problem and provides recommendations.
